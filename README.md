# LottoRaffle

## Why i make it?
I was too lazy to choose the lottery number every time, so I wanted to make a program to replace it.

## How to work it?
1. Reset all number 1 to 45.
2. The six numbers are drawn without duplicate and repeat them five times.
3. The remaining 15 numbers except for 30 numbers are allowed to be duplicated to draw 5 games of 6 each.

## What use in this program?
* React, Javascript, PostCss, HTML
